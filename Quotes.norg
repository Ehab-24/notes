** Meditations
*** Nature
    $ Nature
    The natural order of things; everything does what it is made to do

    > Don't you see the planets, the birds and bees going about their indiviual tasks, puttinh the world in order as best they can? And you are not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren't you running to do what your nature demands?

    > To be beautiful and awe-inspiring is what a tree is made to do

    > It is your duty to be the kindest most virtuous human being that you can be
    -- This is your natural order

    > Unfulfilled potential is the only thing truly worth fearing

*** Wealth
    > Recieve wealth or prosperity without arrogance, and be ready to let it go

    > Material things ultimately do not matter
    -- Because they do not fulfil your potential

*** Death
    > Death is a duty
    -- just like fulfilling your potential
